## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process
- Used Angular framework to build the application.
- Used Reactive form validtion functions for displaying error message even though the there only one field keeping in mind that future form fields can be added.
- created error message directive which sets aria-invalid and aria-errormessage accesibility attributes to the input field.
- created a error message component which display error based on type of validation errors

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) with reactive forms and validation functions for implementing the email validations.
- Directive to bind aria-invalid and aria-errormessage to input field and listener for blur output.
